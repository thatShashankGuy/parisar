In my 6 years of career in IT, I have been fortunate enough to wear many hats and take on various roles and projects. 
Currently working with Wink Technologies as a Senior Software engineer (Products). 
Working in various tech spaces including web application, network applications, 
Cloud Automation DevOps, RPA automation, production support, business intelligence etc. gave me a wide perspective 
and appreciation for various business and technological solutions we provide for them.
