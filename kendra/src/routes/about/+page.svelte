<h1><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> A little bit about me </h1>
   <p>In my 6 years of career in IT I have been fortunate enough to wear many hats and take on various roles and projects. Currently working with Winjit Technologies as a Senior Software engineer.</p> 
   <p>Working in various tech spaces including web application, network applications, Cloud Automation DevOps, RPA automation, production support, business intelligent etc. gave me a wide perspective and appreciation for various business and technological solutions we provide for them.</p> 
   <p>My keen interest in computer science goes beyond my day job and i like fiddling around new paradigms , languages and abstract concepts which fills most of my unstructured git repositories.</p> 
   <p>I believe in providing solutions in a manner which not only solves an existing problem but also let you open room for new use cases.</p> 
   <p>I am an avid reader and prefer hardcopies over ebooks. I love gaming and between that and my job i spend most of time staring at different screens</p>
