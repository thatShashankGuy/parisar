          <p>
            In my 6 years of career in IT ,I have been fortunate enough to wear
            many hats and take on various roles and projects. Currently working
            with Winjit Technologies as a Senior Software engineer (Products) .
            Working in various tech spaces including web application, network
            applications, Cloud Automation DevOps, RPA automation, production
            support, business intelligent etc. gave me a wide perspective and
            appreciation for various business and technological solutions we
            provide for them.

            My keen interest in computer science goes beyond my day job and i
            like fiddling around new paradigms , languages and abstract concepts
            which fills most of my unstructured git repositories.
            </p>
        <p>
           I believe in
            providing solutions in a manner which not only solves an existing
            problem but also let you open room for new use cases.

            I am an avid reader and prefer hardcopies over ebooks. I love gaming
            and between that and my job i spend most of time staring at
            different screens
